# PBLJ-Lab-Experiment-5 (Wrapper Classes, I/O Streams and Lambda Experssion)
## Topics Covered
### 1. Wrapper Classes in Java
- Integer, Character, Long, Boolean
- Autoboxing and Unboxing

### 2. Streams and Serialization
- Byte Stream, Character Stream, Object Serialization, Cloning

### 3. Lambda Expressions and Functional Programming
- Lambda Syntax, Functional Interfaces, Method References
  
## ðŸ“Œ Experiment 5: Develop Java programs using autoboxing, serialization, file handling, and efficient data processing and management.

| Program    | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **[5.1) Easy](/Exp5.1.java)** |Write a Java program to calculate the sum of a list of integers using autoboxing and unboxing. Include methods to parse strings into their respective wrapper classes (e.g.,Integer.parseInt()). |
| **[5.2) Medium](/Exp5.2.java)** |Create a Java program to serialize and deserialize a Student object. The program should: Serialize a Student object (containing id, name, and GPA) and save it to a file. Deserialize the object from the file and display the student details. Handle FileNotFoundException, IOException, and ClassNotFoundException using exception handling. |
| **[5.3) Hard](/Exp5.3.java)** | Create a menu-based Java application with the following options. 1.Add an Employee 2. Display All 3. Exit If option 1 is selected, the application should gather details of the employee like employee name, employee id, designation and salary and store it in a file. If option 2 is selected, the application should display all the employee details. If option 3 is selected the applicationÂ shouldÂ exit. |
