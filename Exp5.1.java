Question Explanation:

writing a Java program to calculate the sum of a list of integers using autoboxing and unboxing, along with methods to parse strings into their respective wrapper classes (e.g., Integer.parseInt()).

Steps to implement:
1. Create a List of Integers: Initialize a List<Integer> to hold the integers.
2. Autoboxing: Use autoboxing to convert primitive int values to Integer objects automatically when adding to the list.
3. Unboxing: Use unboxing to convert Integer objects back to int for sum calculation.
4. Parse Strings: Create a utility method to parse strings to integers using Integer.parseInt().
5. Calculate the Sum: Use a loop or Java 8 streams to calculate the sum of the list.

  
Java Program:

parseStringToInteger(): This method parses a string into an Integer. It catches any NumberFormatException if the string is not a valid number.
calculateSum(): This method calculates the sum of a list of integers. Java automatically performs unboxing when adding Integer values to sum (an int).




Test Cases:

Test Case 1:
Input: 10, 20, 30, "40", "50"
Expected Output: The sum of the list is: 150
Description: The list contains a mix of primitive integers and integers parsed from strings.

Test Case 2:
Input: "100", "200", "300"
Expected Output: The sum of the list is: 600
Description: All values are parsed from strings, and the sum is calculated.

Test Case 3:
Input: "50", "invalid", "70"
Expected Output:
Invalid number format: invalid
The sum of the list is: 120
Description: One of the inputs is not a valid integer, so it's skipped, and the sum of valid values is calculated.
